## Reflection
Working on this portfolio project helped me understand how to structure a complete website using HTML and CSS. I learned how to organize my files properly, link different pages together, and design a layout that reflects my personality and style. Throughout the process, I faced challenges such as fixing layout issues, adjusting spacing, and solving Git errors, but each problem helped me improve my troubleshooting skills. I also learned how to use GitHub for version control and how to host my site using GitHub Pages, which made my project feel more real and professional. This experience boosted my confidence in web development and showed me that I can build and publish a functional website from scratch. Overall, the project helped me grow both technically and creatively.
